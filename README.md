## Context of Project
Design	and	build	a	web	application	(a	feature	inside	a	job	website)	as	follows:
- Create Resume
- Search for a candidate.

## Expected	results:
- Assume that you have jobseekers registered with your website.
- Now	they	click	the	button	to	create	a	CV.
- A	form	appears	for	them	to	fill	in.
- We	don’t	know	how	many	degrees	the	jobseeker	had,	so	the	form	shows	1	input	
field,	after	jobseeker	complete	the	field,	the	second	field	appears,	and	so	on.
- The	jobseeker	could	fill	in data	or	select data from	the	list.
- After	pressing	submit,	make	sure	you	validate	all	the	data,	with	using	JS	and	then	PHP.	If	everything	is	correct,	you	insert	data	into	database.
- Employers	can	search	for	the	right	candidate(s).
